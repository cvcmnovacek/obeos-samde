OBEOS stands for Ontology Based EO Search.
The OBEOS Metadata Editor is a open-source project associated with OBEOS, 
with the goal to develop an editor for Earth Obeservation (EO) metadata
which runs in a Liferay portal, and proesses ISO 19139 and ISO 19139-2 
metadata files.

The development of the Metadata Editor executed by Siemens Convergence
Creators, Prague, is funded by the European Space Agency.

Note about Java versions:
Java 1.8 or newer is recommended.  While the editor v1.0.1 will compile
under Java 1.7, there may be issues with connecting to certain sites
running https.  Java 1.8 has modern default settings for the underlying SSL
protocol including cypher suites, which may not be set up with Java 1.7.
